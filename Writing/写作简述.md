        When it comes to whether parents should be involved in their children's future, opinions vary among people. Some may argue that the youngsters make a live by themselves now, while others say that the opposite is right: parents step aside and let their children make their sown decision. There is probably some truth in both statements, but I side with the latter viewpoint individually.

        First off, making the independent decisions allows children to persist in what they interest and get success. Take my brother Gabe for instance. He used to work in a delivery company with low prospects according to his parents advice. However, things have been changed after he decided to make some changes to devote himself to what he really likes. So, he establish a computer company to reveal his talent in programming. Although there were many tough times through the process, he got a success eventually to sell his program to people from all over the world. So it seems clear to me that it was his own choice that made him meet with success.

        Admittedly, being filled of experiences is a role character of parents' suggestions which help children to make a better choice. However, the world changes rapidly everyday, many experiences of those suggestions are out of date nowadays. For example, they used to choose undergraduate majors which are almost the traditional natural science subjects like math, physical, chemical and so on. When we went to university, however, what our parents had chosen from just a part of the major list. The other majors that they even haven't heard contain the trend of the technology and science like big data, artificial intelligence, so what we more need is the latest information but not the outdated suggestions to determine our own future.
