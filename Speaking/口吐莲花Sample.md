## 口吐莲花Sample

### 第十二期
#### Question
    Some people prefer to make friends with people who are of the same age. Other people prefer to make friends with people who are of different ages. Which one do you prefer? And Why?

#### Sample
    I think it is better to make friends with people who are different ages than make friends only with people who are the same age.

    Older people have seen changes in the world that I have not. It is interesting to hear about events that I read about in history books. Friends of other generations make the past real.

    We can also use our friends' experiences to help solve problems. Older people can teach me about things that I have not yet undergone, and in turn, I can teach younger people. If friends are the same age, we have less diversity to draw upon when facing new experiences.

    Therefore, I think that it is best to have friends who are not the same age.

### 第十一期
#### Question
    If universities are given financial support to develop research, which of the following fields do you think the universities should pursue:

    To predict weather more accurately

    To develop an effective method to clean rivers and oceans

    To develop outer space research.

#### Sample
    I think that if universities are given financial support for research, they should develop an effective method to clean rivers and oceans.

    Oceans and rivers are essential to the well-being of the Earth because all life depends upon water. If it is polluted, animals and plants will become sick or die. We must find a solution quickly to protect the environment.

    I think money should be used for the greatest good. Rivers and oceans extend beyond national boundaries, so devising a method to clean them would help not just one region, but the entire world.

    Because good water quality is essential for everything that lives on Earth, I think universities should use financial support to develop a way to clean rivers and oceans.

### 第十期
#### Question
    Some people believe that the library should be a place for students to have meetings and discussions, while others believe that the library is supposed to be a quiet place where students can focus on their study. Which one do you prefer and why?

#### Sample
    I think that libraries should be quiet places where students can focus on their study. If libraries regularly host meetings and discussions, there will be even fewer public places where a person can really concentrate than there are now.

    Some students have the luxury of quiet rooms in their homes, but many students share bedrooms with siblings or live in apartments filled with outside noise. These students are at a serious disadvantage and should be allowed to study in peace in a library so that they can remain academically competitive with their peers.

    Furthermore, libraries contain many valuable resources which you can’t check out. For example, my local library has maps that you can only use in a certain room. If libraries are noisy, then students will have a hard time paying attention when using such materials.

    Therefore, I think libraries should be quiet places for students with noisy homes to study and for people to concentrate when using resources that they cannot take somewhere else.

### 第九期 - 少年，请说出你的故事
#### Question
    Describe an unusual experience you had. What did you do to avoid being nervous?

#### Sample
    One of the scariest experiences I have had is going rock climbing with my friend. It was hard not to be nervous when I was high in the air holding onto the side of a cliff. I conquered my fear by listening to my friend’s advice and paying attention to my senses.

    First, I focused on my friend's voice. He was an experienced climber so gave good advice, such as telling me where to put my hands and feet. He was encouraging and helpful, so I knew that I was not alone.

    Second, I controlled my fear by concentrating on the rocks and rope. The rock was rough and slightly warm under my hands. The breeze against my face was cool and smelled sweet. I could taste my own sweat. I felt calmer when I touched and looked at things around me.

    When I paid attention to my senses and listened to my friend's advice, I was not as scared about rock climbing.

### 第八期 - 俗话说，活到老，学到老
#### Question
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It's never too late to obtain the college degree, no matter how old you are.

#### Sample
    I agree with the statement that it is never too late to obtain a college degree. Even if a person is well into retirement age, there are benefits from obtaining a degree because degrees are not just useful for getting a job.

    Getting a college degree helps the person remain mentally engaged. Older people face the very real threat of forgetfulness or dementia. Taking courses towards a degree keeps the mind active and challenged. Also, older people often face the problems of isolation and lack of initiative once they retire. Participating in college discussions and projects encourages interaction with other students, so a person striving for a college degree remains socially engaged as well.

    Therefore, I agree that it’s never too late to obtain a college degree, no matter how old someone is.


### 第七期 - 考高分，应该有奖励么？
#### Question
    Should parents reward children with money when they get good grades？

#### Sample
    I do not think that parents should reward children with money for good grades because it undermines the benefits of learning.

    Learning is an essential life-long skill that children must acquire, and grades in school are only steps along the way. If children associate grades with money, they may not see the value of learning for the sake of bettering oneself.

    Not only is knowledge reduced to financial gain, but students may also learn less in class because they are focused on memorizing specific points to pass a test rather than understanding the process of solving problems. Without such creative thinking skills, children are not well prepared for obstacles in the world outside the classroom.

    Therefore, it is better for parents not to reward good grades with money.

### 第六期 - 第五期 都是写作范文

### 第四期 - 未来何去何从，该不该听父母劝
#### Question
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents should discourage children from choosing a career that is less likely to be successful, such as in athletics or in the entertainment industry.

#### Sample
    I disagree with the statement that parents should discourage children from choosing a certain career because it is unlikely to be successful. Instead, I think that parents should encourage their children in the most suitable fields for that child.

    The reason is because every child is different. Although it is true that most children may not be fit for athletics, there are some children who are. Parents of such a child should not automatically discourage the child from a sports career just because it is difficult.

    Likewise, there are children who are not cut out for a traditional career. Such a person may become depressed and perform poorly, for example, working in an office. It is better to help that child succeed in a more unconventional job that matches his or her skills.

    I think it is better to steer a child towards a career where he or she will thrive rather than just telling the child to avoid certain careers.

### 第三期 - 政府说，财政紧张了
#### Question
    The government has a limited budget. Which of the following do you think is the most important field to invest that money in?

    education
    space exploration
    health care

#### Sample
    If the government has a limited budget, I think it should invest the money in education, because that creates a solid foundation for all other fields to build upon.

    It is essential to have a population that is able to read, write, and do mathematics. Without those skills, people cannot solve even basic problems like calculating the amount of material they need to build something or read the label on a package.

    It is also impossible for a country to advance without an educated population. Fields such as health care and space exploration will crumble because people will not have the skills to do research and invent new things.

    Therefore, I think that a government should invest its money in education.

### 第二期 - 什么样的朋友才会真正的好朋友
#### Question
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Close friends should be honest and open.

#### Sample
    I definitely agree with the statement that close friends should be honest and open because those qualities are the foundation for any strong relationship.

    It is easiest to see the importance of honesty if you look at its opposite:if people lie, relationships fall apart. Friends lose trust in each other. If a person lies to a friend, the friend will no longer have faith in even simple actions, promises, and comments.

    By contrast, if friends are always honest and open, they can trust each other. Friends can therefore turn to each other for advice and support, helping each other improve and grow to the best of their abilities. Friends can accept suggestions and comments at face value without having to second-guess the real meaning behind them.

    There is no doubt in my mind that the statement that friends should be open and honest with each other is true.

### 第一期 - 博物馆要开新展区了，这个队怎么站

#### Question
    The museum decides to open a new section for exhibition. Which of the following do you prefer?

    1) robot technology

    2) ocean animals

    3) solar system

#### Sample
    If a museum in my area were to open a new exhibit, I would prefer to see a section about ocean animals. Other topics are also interesting, but ocean animals have several qualities that make them an excellent choice.

    > Other topics are also interesting, but XXX have several qualities that make it an excellent choice.

    Ocean animals are very concrete things that you can see and touch, so even the youngest museum visitors could easily learn about them. Displays could range from simple introductions to the animals and habitat to complex coverage of ecosystems, so visitors of all ages and interest levels could be engaged.

    In addition, oceans are an important part of the Earth but are currently at serious risk to environmental problems such as global warming, pollution, and oil spills. An exhibit about ocean animals and the dangers they face could persuade audiences to take action to save this valuable resource.

    Because ocean animals appeal to a wide range of ages and can influence people to help protect the environment, I think that they would be a good topic for a museum exhibit.
